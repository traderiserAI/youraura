        <h1>AI Transparency: How Our Models Work</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> Most wellness apps treat their AI as a "black box." We think that's wrong. You deserve to know exactly how our AI works, what data it uses, and its limitations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The 5 AI Models</h2>

        <div class="model-card">
            <h3>1. K-Means Clustering (Archetype Classifier)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Matches you with one of 5 wellness archetypes based on your quiz responses.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Compares your answers to thousands of other users' profiles and finds which cluster (archetype) you're closest to.</p>
            <p><strong>Data used:</strong> Your 7 quiz responses only</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> ~85% of users report their archetype "feels accurate"</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Not a diagnosis. Simplified model of complex human beings. Based on current state, not permanent identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model-card">
            <h3>2. Q-Learning (Adaptive Quiz)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Chooses which question to ask next based on your previous answers.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the "best question" to ask in each situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Data used:</strong> Your answers to previous questions + patterns from thousands of quiz completions</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reaches 85% classification accuracy in 7 questions (vs. 10-12 with static quiz)</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Requires at least 3 answers to start adapting. May occasionally ask redundant questions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model-card">
            <h3>3. LSTM (Behavioral Pattern Analyzer)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Analyzes 14 days of your check-ins to surface early stress signals.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Neural network that finds patterns in sequences of data over time (like rising stress + declining energy).</p>
            <p><strong>Data used:</strong> 14 days of your self-reported mood, energy, and stress levels</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 70% of users who received alerts agreed they were feeling more stressed</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>‚ùå NOT predictive medicine - this is pattern recognition, not medical prediction</li>
                    <li>‚ùå Requires 14 days of data to provide insights</li>
                    <li>‚ùå Cannot diagnose burnout, depression, or any medical condition</li>
                    <li>‚ùå 20% false positive rate (alerts when you feel fine)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This model surfaces informational insights based on patterns in your self-reported data. It is NOT a diagnostic tool and cannot predict future health outcomes with certainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model-card">
            <h3>4. RecBole (Recommendation Engine)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Suggests personalized daily recommendations (yoga, meditation, CBT exercises).</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Collaborative filtering (like Netflix) - learns from your engagement and similar users' preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>Data used:</strong> Your archetype + your engagement with past recommendations + aggregated data from similar users</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 40% of recommended practices are completed (vs. 15% for random recommendations)</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Less accurate in first week (not enough data about your preferences). May create "filter bubble" by over-recommending things you already like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model-card">
            <h3>5. Conversational AI (Chatbot)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Provides 24/7 informational support via chat in English or Telugu.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Large language model (Llama 3 or BlenderBot) fine-tuned on wellness conversations.</p>
            <p><strong>Data used:</strong> Your messages + your archetype + recent check-ins (for context) + conversation history</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 85% of users rate responses as "helpful" or "very helpful"</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>‚ùå NOT a therapist - this is a chatbot, not a licensed mental health professional</li>
                    <li>‚ùå Cannot handle crises (will direct you to 988 or local resources)</li>
                    <li>‚ùå May occasionally generate incorrect or nonsensical responses ("hallucinations")</li>
                    <li>‚ùå Only remembers last 10 messages in a conversation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Safety:</strong> 95% crisis detection rate. If you mention self-harm or suicide, the chatbot immediately provides crisis resources.</p>
        </div>
